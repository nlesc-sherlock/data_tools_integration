Users can specify the Docker images they want for their YARN containers. These containers provide a custom software environment in which the user&#x2019;s code runs, isolated from the software environment of the NodeManager. These containers can include special libraries needed by the application, and they can have different versions of Perl, Python, and even Java than what is installed on the NodeManager. Indeed, these containers can run a different flavor of Linux than what is running on the NodeManager &#x2013; although the YARN container must define all the environments and libraries needed to run the job, nothing will be shared with the NodeManager."/>

Mesos is a distributed systems kernel that stitches together a lot of different machines into a logical computer. It was born for a world where you own a lot of physical resources to create a big static computing cluster. The great thing about it is that lots of modern scalable data processing application run well on Mesos (Hadoop, Kafka, Spark) and it is nice because you can run them all on the same basic resource pool, along with your new age container packaged apps. It is somewhat more heavy weight than the Kubernetes project, but is getting easier and easier to manage thanks to the work of folks like Mesosphere."/>
<node CREATED="1445260865939" ID="ID_779772753" MODIFIED="1445260867039" TEXT="Now what gets really interesting is that Mesos is currently being adapted to add a lot of the Kubernetes concepts and to support the Kubernetes API. So it will be a gateway to getting more capabilities for your Kubernetes app (high availability master, more advanced scheduling semantics, ability to scale to a very large number of nodes) if you need them, and is well suited to run production workloads (Kubernetes is still in an alpha state)."/>
<node CREATED="1445260881349" ID="ID_999172359" MODIFIED="1445260889743" TEXT="1. Kubernetes is a great place to start if you are new to the clustering world; it is the quickest, easiest and lightest way to kick the tires and start experimenting with cluster oriented development. It offers a very high level of portability since it is being supported by a lot of different providers (Microsoft, IBM, Red Hat, CoreOs, MesoSphere, VMWare, etc)."/>

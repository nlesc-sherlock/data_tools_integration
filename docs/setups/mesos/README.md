Mesos
================

From the [mesos web-site]() "Apache Mesos abstracts CPU, memory, storage, and other compute resources away from
machines (physical or virtual), enabling fault-tolerant and elastic distributed systems to easily be built and
run effectively. Mesos is built using the same principles as the Linux kernel, only at a different level of
abstraction. The Mesos kernel runs on every machine and provides applications (e.g., Hadoop, Spark, Kafka, Elastic
Search) with APIâ€™s for resource management and scheduling across entire datacenter and cloud environments.".

The [mesos architecture](http://mesos.apache.org/documentation/latest/architecture/) shows the main components
of Mesos. Mesos consists of a master daemon that manages slave daemons running on each cluster node, and mesos
applications (also called frameworks) that run tasks on these slaves. More information can be found in their
[technical paper](http://mesos.berkeley.edu/mesos_tech_report.pdf).
